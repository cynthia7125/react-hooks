## [UseState](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState)
- Lets us track state easily with little ceremony.

## [UseEffect](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect)
- Gives us a clean way to set things typiically state when components start and finish.

## [UseRef](https://react.dev/reference/react/useRef)
- Gives us the control we need to get to DOM elements when other means are not straightforward.

## [useContext](https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext)
- Allows you to pass data down the component tree without propdrilling

## [useReducer](https://react.dev/reference/react/useReducer)
- Gave us a nice way to organise our state management.

## [useCallback](https://react.dev/reference/react/useCallback)
- Gave us a nice performance gain by not having all  our cartoon detail page re-rendered every time a button is clicked.

## [useMemo](https://react.dev/reference/react/useMemo)
- Helped us cache some data on our cleint saving some compute time on our app and hopefully making it more responsive.

### What needs to be fixed
1. Unliking the cartoon is impossible
2. Unchecking the Sunday and Saturday check boxes shows the images that were not initially in view to remain gray.
